Checklogo8p1.exe Instructions 
    The following steps describe how to use checklogo8p1.exe. 
    Checklogo8p1.exe is a tool that checks that installed drivers do not have problem codes, are properly signed and certified for the running operating system.
    Checklogo8p1.exe replaces previous chklogoX.exe and is the standalone version of the DriverAssessment.exe that ships in the Hardware Certification Kit (HCK) and Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK).

1.	Create a folder called checklogo in the root of the C: drive of the System that you want to test.
2.	Copy the correct version of Checklog binaries according to the processor architecture on the target machine:
            Copy binaries under CheckLogo_x64 folder to c:\checklogo if target machine runs AMD64 processor
            Copy binaries under CheckLogo_x86 folder to c:\checklogo if target machine runs x86 processor
3.	Open an elevated command prompt window.
4.	From the elevated command prompt:
	i.	Type “cd\checklogo” in the command window to get to the c:\checklogo directory
	ii.	To execute the test, type: Checklogo8p1.exe /checklogo
	iii.	After the tool completes, open the “CheckCertification_failedlist.txt” file to see any failures.

	Notes: 
	1.	The command prompt output may indicate “Unable to load axecore.dll – Could not find dll”. It is safe to ignore this warning. Axecore.dll is a dll utilized by the Driver Assessment when it’s run as part of the Assessment and Deployment Kit (ADK). The tool searches for this dll and fails to find it. This is by design and will not impact the results generated by the tool.
	2.	The command prompt output may indicate various items related to number of drivers, devices found/loaded/results saved. It is safe to ignore this additional information.
	3.	The test may produce additional txt and xml files. Ignore these additional files. “CheckCertification_failedlist.txt” alone indicates whether Windows hardware device drivers are unsigned or not.
